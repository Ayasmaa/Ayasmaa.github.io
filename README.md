# Anime

## Explanation

Anime (アニメ) is a Japanese term for hand-drawn or computer animation. The word is the abbreviated pronunciation of "animation" in Japanese, where this 
term references all animation. Outside Japan, anime is used to refer specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style.
Anime consists of an ideal story-telling mechanism, combining graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and 
individualistic techniques. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of 
camera effects, including panning, zooming, and angle shots. Being hand-drawn, anime is separated from reality by a crucial gap of fiction that provides an 
ideal path for escapism that audiences can immerse themselves into with relative ease.

## History and Development

The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1917.
The first generation of animators in the late 1910s included Ōten Shimokawa, Jun'ichi Kōuchi and Seitaro Kitayama, commonly referred to as the "fathers" of 
anime. Propaganda films, such as Momotarō no Umiwashi (1943) and Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei (1945), the latter being the first anime feature film, were made 
during World War II. During the 1970s, anime developed further, separating itself from its Western roots, and developing distinct genres such as mecha and 
its super robot subgenre. Typical shows from this period include Astro Boy, Lupin III and Mazinger Z. During this period several filmmakers became famous, 
especially Hayao Miyazaki and Mamoru Oshii.
